Create an iOS application that serves the Tweeter interface. It will support the following functionality:
//                a. Allow the user to input and send messages.
//                b Display the user's messages.
//                c. If a user's input is less than or equal to 50 characters, post it as is.
//                d. If a user's input is greater than 50 characters, split it into chunks that
//                each is less than or equal to 50 characters and post each chunk as a separate message.
//                e. Messages will only be split on whitespace. If the message contains a span of non-whitespace characters longer than 50 characters, display an error.
//                f. Split messages will have a "part indicator" appended to the beginning of each section. In the example above, the message was split into two chunks, so the part indicators read "1/2" an "2/2". Be aware that these count toward the character limit.
//                2. The functionality that splits messages should be a standalone function. Given the above example, its function call would look like:
//                3. The app must be in Swift.
